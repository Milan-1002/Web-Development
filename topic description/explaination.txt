CSS POSITIONING:

1. static
--> defalult
-go step by step. or one by one

2. Relative
-->when we use this. this will gonna move our object relative to its original positon
for ex. static will place the item one by one so relative gonna place the item relative to the static position


3. Absolute
--> Position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner or webpage
 
Z-INDEX = higher z-index gonna sit top of hte lower z-index
        = every element on the screen will have defalult z-index of 0.


4. Fixed
--> positon relative to top left corner of browser window
