CSS POSITIONING:

1. static
--> defalult
-go step by step. or one by one

2. Relative
-->when we use this. this will gonna move our object relative to its original positon
for ex. static will place the item one by one so relative gonna place the item relative to the static position


3. Absolute
--> Position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner or webpage
 
Z-INDEX = higher z-index gonna sit top of hte lower z-index
        = every element on the screen will have defalult z-index of 0.


4. Fixed
--> positon relative to top left corner of browser window


CSS DISPLAY:

mainly three types of display:
1. Inline = it fits all the elelment in the same line

2. Inline-block = this is the combination of inline and block. inline sets the element in the same line
                  block feature is useful to sets the height and width of the block

3. none = hides the certain element from the screen 


*************CSS FLOAT***********

1. float = right/left  --> this will help in wrap the text around the element let's say image. we can choose right or left value

2. clear: left/right  --> this will clear the float and place in normal place
